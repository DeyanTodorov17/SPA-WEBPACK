  This is a simple single page application where you can add your favorite movies.
  
 I used firebase for cloud database and there are all movies and users which are added in the application.
 For routing I used a router library (VAADIN ROUTER) which is a client-side router for web components.
 For templating I used a library(lit-html).
 
  First you need to register a user.
  A logged-in user can see all movies which are currently added.
  
  If you add a movie you are creator of this movie. So you can delete and edit it. Noone else can do it.
  If you aren't a creator of a movie you can like a movie once and after that you can see number of total likes of this movie.
